# Whale-and-Dolphin-ID

This is my code and submission for the Kaggle competition: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/happy-whale-and-dolphin. This was done as part of the Final Project for the course CS444: Deep Learning for Computer Vision.

There are two notebooks in this project. The repo also includes the Report which contains detailed instructions on how to run the notebooks
